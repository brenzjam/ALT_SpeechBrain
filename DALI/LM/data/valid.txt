ANYTIME I
NEED TO SEE YOUR FACE
I JUST CLOSE MY EYES
AND I AM TAKEN TO A
PLACE WHERE YOUR CRYSTAL MIND
AND MAGENTA FEELINGS
TAKE UP SHELTER
IN THE BASE OF MY SPINE
SWEET LIKE A CHICA CHERRY COLA
I DON'T NEED TO
TRY AND EXPLAIN
I JUST HOLD ON TIGHT
AND IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN
I MIGHT MOVE SO SLIGHTLY
TO THE ARMS AND THE LIPS
AND THE FACE OF THE
HUMAN CANNONBALL
THAT I NEED TO I WANT TO AH

OOH I'D DIE TO FIND OUT
OOH I WANT YOU I DON'T
KNOW IF I NEED YOU BUT
OOH I WOULD
DIE TO FIND OUT
I'M THE KIND OF PERSON
WHO ENDORSES A
DEEP COMMITMENT
GETTING COMFY
GETTING PERFECT
IS WHAT I LIVE FOR
BUT A LOOK AND THEN A
SMELL OF PERFUME
IT'S LIKE I'M DOWN ON THE FLOOR
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M IN FOR
CONVERSATION HAS A
TIME AND PLACE IN THE
INTERACTION OF A
LOVER AND A MATE
BUT THE TIME OF TALKING
USING SYMBOLS
USING WORDS CAN BE
LIKENED TO A DEEP SEA DIVER
WHO IS SWIMMING
WITH A RAINCOAT
WELL COME STAND A
LITTLE BIT CLOSER
BREATHE IN AND
GET A BIT HIGHER
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
WHAT HIT YOU WHEN
I GET TO YOU
OOH I WANT YOU I DON'T
KNOW IF I NEED YOU BUT
OOH I'D DIE TO FIND OUT
OOH I WANT YOU I DON'T
KNOW IF I NEED YOU BUT
OOH I WOULD
DIE TO FIND OUT
OOH YEAH YEAH
OOH YEAH YEAH
ANYTIME I
NEED TO SEE YOUR FACE
I JUST CLOSE MY EYES

IN THE MIDDLE OF A GUN FIGHT
IN THE CENTER OF A RESTAURANT
THEY SAY
COME WITH YOUR ARMS RAISED HIGH
WELL THEY'RE NEVER GONNA GET ME
LIKE A BULLET THROUGH A FLOCK OF DOVES
TO WAGE
THIS WAR AGAINST
YOUR FAITH
IN ME
YOUR LIFE
WILL NEVER
BE THE SAME
ON YOUR MOTHER'S LIFE
SAY A PRAYER
SAY A PRAYER
NOW BUT I CAN'T
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW WE'RE JUST TWO MEN
AS GOD HAD MADE US
WELL I CAN'T
WELL I CAN
TOO MUCH TOO LATE
OR JUST NOT ENOUGH OF THIS
PAIN IN MY HEART FOR YOUR DYING WISH
I'LL KISS YOUR LIPS
AGAIN
THEY ALL CHEAT AT CARDS
AND THE CHECKERS ARE LOST
MY CELL MATE'S A KILLER
THEY MADE ME DO PUSHUPS IN DRAG
BUT NOBODY CARES
IF YOU'RE LOSING YOURSELF
AM I LOSING MYSELF
WELL I MISS MY MOM
GIVE ME THE CHAIR
OR LETHAL INJECTION
OR SWING FROM A ROPE IF YOU DARE
AH NOBODY KNOWS
ALL THE TROUBLE I'VE SEEN
NOW BUT I CAN'T
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW WE'RE JUST TWO MEN
AS GOD HAD MADE US
WELL I CAN'T
WELL I CAN
TOO MUCH TOO LATE
OR JUST NOT ENOUGH OF THIS
PAIN IN MY HEART FOR YOUR DYING WISH
I'LL KISS YOUR LIPS
AGAIN
TO YOUR ROOM
WHAT THEY ASK OF YOU
WILL MAKE YOU WANT
TO SAY
SO LONG
BUT I DON'T
REMEMBER
WHY REMEMBER
YOU
DO YOU HAVE THE KEYS TO THE HOTEL
'CAUSE I'M GONNA STRING THIS MOTHERFUCKER ON FIRE
LIFE IS BUT A
DREAM
FOR THE DEAD
AND WELL I

WANING PATIENCE

DISPOSSESSED FROM ALL THE ATTRACTIONS
DANCING BEARS OF EROTICISM
SELF ABSORBED DELUSION

I TURN MY BACK TO THE WIND
TO CATCH MY BREATH
BEFORE I START OFF AGAIN
DRIVEN ON WITHOUT A MOMENT TO SPEND
TO PASS AN EVENING
WITH DRINK AND A FRIEND
I LET MY SKIN GET TOO THIN
I'D LIKE TO PAUSE
NO MATTER WHAT I PRETEND
LIKE SOME PILGRIM
WHO LEARNS TO TRANSCEND
LEARNS TO LIVE AS IF EACH STEP WAS THE END
I'M NOT LOOKING BACK
BUT I WANT TO LOOK AROUND ME NOW
SEE MORE OF THE PEOPLE
AND THE PLACES THAT SURROUND ME NOW
TIME STAND STILL
FREEZE THIS MOMENT A LITTLE BIT LONGER
MAKE EACH SENSATION A LITTLE BIT STRONGER
EXPERIENCE SLIPS AWAY
EXPERIENCE SLIPS AWAY
TIME STANDS STILL
I TURN MY FACE TO THE SUN
I CLOSE MY EYES
LET MY DEFENCES DOWN
ALL THOSE WOUNDS THAT I CAN'T GET UNWOUND
I LET MY PAST GO TOO FAST
NO TIME TO PAUSE
IF I COULD SLOW IT ALL DOWN
LIKE SOME CAPTAIN
WHOSE SHIP RUNS AGROUND
I CAN WAIT UNTIL THE TIDE COMES AROUND
I'M NOT LOOKING BACK
BUT I WANT TO LOOK AROUND ME NOW
SEE MORE OF THE PEOPLE
AND THE PLACES THAT SURROUND ME NOW
FREEZE THIS MOMENT A LITTLE BIT LONGER
MAKE EACH SENSATION A LITTLE BIT STRONGER
MAKE EACH IMPRESSION A LITTLE BIT STRONGER
FREEZE THIS MOTION A LITTLE BIT LONGER

TIME AFTER TIME
SO LONG IT WAS SO LONG AGO
BUT I'VE STILL GOT THE BLUES FOR YOU
USED TO BE SO EASY

YOU'RE PLAYING TO WIN
BUT YOU'LL LOOSE JUST THE SAME
SO LONG IT WAS SO LONG AGO
BUT I'VE STILL GOT THE BLUES FOR YOU
SO MANY YEARS
SINCE I'VE SEEN YOUR FACE

THE EASTERN WORLD IT IS EXPLODING
VIOLENCE FLARING BULLETS LOADING
YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO KILL BUT NOT FOR VOTING
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN WAR
BUT WHAT'S THAT GUN YOU'RE TOTING
AND EVEN THE JORDAN RIVER HAS
BODIES FLOATING BUT YOU TELL ME
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN MY FRIEND
AH YOU DON'T BELIEVE
WE'RE ON THE EVE OF DESTRUCTION
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
AND CAN'T YOU FEEL THE FEARS
I'M FEARING TODAY
IF THE BUTTON IS PUSHED
THERE'S NO RUNING AWAY
THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO SAVE
WILL THE WORLD IN A GRAVE
TAKE A LOOK AROUND YOU BOY
IT'S BOUND TO SCARE YOU BOY AND YOU TELL ME
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN MY FRIEND
AH YOU DON'T BELIEVE
WE'RE ON THE EVE OF DESTRUCTION
YEAH MY BLOOD'S SO MAD
FEELS LIKE COAGULATION
I'M SITTING HERE JUST CONTEMPLATING
I CAN'T TWIST THE TRUTH IT KNOWS NO REGULATION
HANDFUL OF SENATORS DON'T PASS LEGISLATION
AND MARCHES ALONE CAN'T BRING INTEGRATION
WHEN HUMAN RESPECT IS DISINTEGRATION
THIS WHOLE CRAZY WORLD
IS JUST TOO FRUSTRATING AND YOU TELL ME
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN MY FRIEND
AH YOU DON'T BELIEVE
WE'RE ON THE EVE OF DESTRUCTION
THINK OF ALL THE HATE THERE IS IN RED CHINA
THEN TAKE A LOOK AROUND TO SELMA ALABAMA
AH YOU MAY LEAVE HERE FOR FOUR DAYS IN SPACE
BUT WHEN YOU RETURN IT'S THE SAME OLD PLACE
THE POUNDING OF THE DRUMS
THE PRIDE AND DISGRACE
YOU CAN BURRY YOUR DEAD
BUT DON'T LEAVE A TRACE
HATE YOUR NEXTDOOR NEIGHBOUR
BUT DON'T FORGET TO SAY GRACE AND TELL ME
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
MY FRIEND
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
WE'RE ON THE EVE OF DESTRUCTION
MMH NO NO
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
WE'RE ON THE EVE OF DESTRUCTION
